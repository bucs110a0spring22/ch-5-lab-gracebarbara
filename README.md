## SUMMARY:
 Using for loops and basic commands within multiple functions (including drawline, drawsquare and drawcircle) I was able to call to each of them in the setupdartboard function in order to draw the board. Then, I used an if statement within another function in order to throw a dart and assign it a color based on whether it fell inside or outside of the board. Another if statement that returned boolean values was used within the isincircle function inorder to determine whether a point would be added to the players score in the play darts game. The play darts game uses another for loop, an accumuator and the existing throwdart function to simulate a back and fourth dart game between two players. Finally, using a monte carlo simulator that includes an accumulator and a loop I was able to find an estimation for pi from the fomula (# darts in circle/total darts)*4.
